The pipeline was run separately for each of the 5 fastq maps shown, always using the parameters file
params.Gradoville_2020.csv.  Each run had its own Data.nobackup output directory with all pipeline
stages (cutadapt, error model creation, DADA2).  I.e. the organization was:

   Directory                           Includes
   =========                           ========
   2019_DNA_Frac_whole_Transition      fastqMap_2019_DNA_Frac_whole_Transition.tsv and the params file
   2017_RNA_Frac_whole_NPSG            fastqMap_2017_RNA_Frac_whole_NPSG.tsv and the params file
   2017_DNA_Frac_whole_Transition.tsv  fastqMap_2017_DNA_Frac_whole_Transition.tsv and the params file
   etc.

For sharing the ASVs on github, it is simpler to provide all 5 result sets as subdirectories within
the same Data.nobackup/Dada2PipeOutput.

If you want to run the pipeline for each of the 5 data sets, please use separate directories as
described above.
