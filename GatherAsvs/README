The Makefile gathers all ASVs generated by various pipeline runs in asvs.noChimera.fasta_table.tsv.

 -- Resolve ASV ID collisions* across the pipeline runs by assigning new IDs ("AUIDs") which are
    meaningful across all runs in asvs.noChimera.fasta_table.tsv.  Generate a FASTA file and an
    abundance table that have nifH amplicons (AUIDs) seen in any of the pipeline runs.  These
    actions are done by assignAUIDs2ASVs.R, an ancillary script in the DADA2 nifH pipeline.  To
    save computation time, the makefile invokes assignAUIDs2ASVs.R with -length=200,450 to remove
    ASVs with lengths that are far outside a reasonable range for nifH.
       * Collisions: Pipeline runs are independent so ASV.1, ASV.2 etc. are not the same sequences
         across runs.
    
 -- Filter out chimeras using uchime3 denovo.  Done at this stage because it makes it simpler for
    check_chimera_denovo.sh to operate separately on each ASV abundance table that the DADA2 nifH
    pipeline outputs (one for each processing group).  It would be possible, but more complicated,
    to do uchime3 denovo filtering in FilterAuids using the merged abundance table
    asv2auid.abundances.tsv.gz.


Main outputs
* asv2auid.tsv                AUID assignments from assignAUIDs2ASVs.R
* asv2auid.fasta              AUID FASTA from assignAUIDs2ASVs.R
* asv2auid.abundances.tsv.gz  AUID abundance table for all studies/samples
