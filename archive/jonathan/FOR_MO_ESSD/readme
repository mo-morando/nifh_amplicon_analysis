* metadata.cmap.tsv comes from the GatherMetadata stage and has the
  CMAP-friendly query fields required by Mo's CMAP script.  It is old (Nov
  2023).  A newer version will be published in ESSD with expected trivial
  differences (e.g. some additional metadata that will have been tracked down).

* auids.annot.tsv was created 17 Jan 2024. AnnotateAuids was re-run in order to
  reflect the removal of a dozen NEMO nutrient-addition samples (the "e15"s).
  Dropping these samples led to somme ASVs no longer existing. However, AUIDs
  were recycled (preservin the earlier AUID numbers whenever the exact same
  nucleotide and length ASV was created in the more recent run of GatherAsvs).
  The marine NCD/cyano DB (with ~267 sequences) was searched as described in
  the Dec manuscript: >=97%id and >=70%cvg.  (Used to search with >=90% cvg.
  Reducing to 70% impact was only to add annotation to a few (4 or 5) AUIDs.)
