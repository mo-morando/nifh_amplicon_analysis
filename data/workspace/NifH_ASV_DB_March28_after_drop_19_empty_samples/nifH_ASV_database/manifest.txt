  These objects comprise the nifH ASV database:
     asvSeqs      ASV sequences, 1:1 with abundTab. Each ASV has an ID of the form 'AUID.<number>'.
                  The number only ensures uniqueness.  It does not indicate the ASV's abundance.
     abundTab     ASV abundance counts for all retained samples. Samples with 0 reads are excluded,
                  for example, those dropped by FilterAuids, or by WorkspaceStartup when ASVs
                  with no annotation get removed.  Every count is an integer so the table can be
                  used with the R vegan package.
     relabundTab  ASV relative abundances for all retained samples.
     annotTab     Annotation for ASVs in abundTab.
     metaTab      Metadata for samples in abundTab.
     cmapTab      Environmental data for samples in abundTab.

  The workspace.RData includes the above as well as the following:
     asvCyanos    Cyanobacteria ASVs based on best hit in Genome879.
     asvNCDs      Non-cyanobacgteria ASVs based on best hit in Genome879.
     GetTaxa()    Find ASVs with a specified taxonomic level (kingdom to genus) based on the ASV's
                  best hit in Genome879.
