Loading libraries...done.
Loading the abundance table...done.  9416 ASVs X 890 working samples.
Note that 6 samples have 0 total reads. They will be dropped after ASV annotations are checked.
Loading sample metadata...done.  8812 samples X 21 metadata variables.
Loading the CMAP environmental variables...done.  887 samples X 105 CMAP environmental variables.

Loading annotation...done.
Loading AUID sequences...Loaded 9416 AUIDs.

Filtering out AUIDs that had no annotation from workflow stage AnnotateAuids:
  Number of rows removed from: 'abundTab':	1507
  Number of rows removed from: 'asvSeqs':	1507
After filtering out unannotated ASVs, there are a total of 25 samples that have 0 total reads. They will be dropped shortly.
ASVs in FASTA and abundance table are 1:1.

Forcing abundTab to have only integers to be vegan-friendly.
After this step there are still 34397432 reads.
Dropping samples that have 0 reads.  25 samples dropped:

Shrinking CMAP and sample metadata tables to have just the samples in the abundance table.
   3 samples in the abundance table have no environmental data (sampsWithoutEnvdata.txt)
   0 samples in the abundance table have no sample metadata (sampsWithoutMetadata.txt)

Checking consistency of data tables (e.g. same AUIDs and samples).

Saved workspace.RData which contains the following:
  These objects comprise the nifH ASV database:
     asvSeqs      ASV sequences, 1:1 with abundTab. Each ASV has an ID of the form 'AUID.<number>'.
                  The number only ensures uniqueness.  It does not indicate the ASV's abundance.
     abundTab     ASV abundance counts for all retained samples. Samples with 0 reads are excluded,
                  for example, those dropped by FilterAuids, or by WorkspaceStartup when ASVs
                  with no annotation get removed.  Every count is an integer so the table can be
                  used with the R vegan package.
     relabundTab  ASV relative abundances for all retained samples.
     annotTab     Annotation for ASVs in abundTab.
     metaTab      Metadata for samples in abundTab.
     cmapTab      Environmental data for samples in abundTab.

  The workspace.RData includes the above as well as the following:
     asvCyanos    Cyanobacteria ASVs based on best hit in Genome879.
     asvNCDs      Non-cyanobacgteria ASVs based on best hit in Genome879.
     GetTaxa()    Find ASVs with a specified taxonomic level (kingdom to genus) based on the ASV's
                  best hit in Genome879.
 
The workspace objects can be used with R tidyverse, or without. No R packages are required.
