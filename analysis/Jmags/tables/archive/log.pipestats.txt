Will use pipeline outputs rooted at ../.. 
Loading ../../GatherAsvs/asvs.noChimera.fasta_table.tsv to get to the pipeline reads at each stage.

Gathering the readCountsDuringProcessing* csv files for every pipeline run
 (processing group), except not for those that had mixed-orientation seq libs.
Found 45 readCountsDuringProcessing* csv's.
Loading the reads at each stage for every pipeline run.
Reformatting the data into a table of sample read pair counts at each stage.

Stats on the % of paired reads retained (when *pipeline* finishes).
 Only includes 960 samples that had >0 non-bimera ASVs.
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  0.006  36.534  55.924  51.646  70.703  89.244 

Stats on the number of paired reads InNonChimericASVs (i.e. pipeline finish):
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
      1   15510   27841   44682   44284  746120 
Writing Table_SreadsAtEachStage_samples.csv 

Also writing out Table_SreadsAtEachStage_studies_medProportions.csv 
 This table has the median (over samples in each study) proportions of reads
 retained at each stage of the DADA2 pipeline. Median Initial and Final counts are
 also provided.

Also writing out Table_SreadsAtEachStage_studies_counts.csv 
 which has the paired read counts at each stage for each study. (Not medians!)

NOTE!  The studies Shiozaki_2017 Shiozaki_2018GBC are mixed-orientation.
 The stats reflect just the Normal pipepline runs, and since ~half of the reads in were
 for the wrong strand and thus rejected, the proportions of reads will be < 50%.
