## Pipeline processing for Shiozaki_2018GBC to handle mixed-orientation sequencing libraries
####################################################################################################

NifH amplicons occur in both orientations in the FASTQs for this data set, i.e. in the forward
FASTQs about half the amplicons are nifH and half are the reverse complement, and similar for the R2
FASTQs.  Clearly these sequencing libaries were prepared by ligating the amplicons (in either
orientation) to the Illumina adapters, as described here:
    https://seekdeep.brown.edu/illumina_paired_info.html

Consequently a special process was used for this study to produce the final ASV results, which are
in the asv.noChimera.combined.* files.

How ASVs were prepared for this study
-------------------------------------

To run the data through our pipeline we use the following approach:

  0. Download the data from the SRA and store the FASTQs in RawFastqs.  You can do this with
     fastq-dump.
  
  1. Run the pipeline the "normal" way using the standard nifH1-4 primers.
     Here are the shell commands to do this:
         cd Normal
         organizeFastqs.R ../fastqMap.Shiozaki_2018GBC.tsv    # makes LinksToFastqs
         run_DADA2_pipeline.sh params.Shiozaki_2018GBC.normal.csv &> log.normal.txt

  2. Run the pipeline the with the forward and reverse primers **swapped**.
         cd Swapped
         organizeFastqs.R ../fastqMap.Shiozaki_2018GBC.tsv
         run_DADA2_pipeline.sh params.Shiozaki_2018GBC.swapped.csv &> log.swapped.txt
         
     Because the pipeline tells cutadapt to drop read pairs that are missing the primers, run #1
     will drop the reads that have nifH ligated in the wrong (i.e. reverse complement of nifH)
     orientation, and run #2 will drop reads that have nifH in the normal orientation.
     
   3. Combine the ASVs from #1 and #2 using the script.
       + FASTAs:  reverse complement the ASVs from #2.
       + Abundance tables: For each sample (a column in the abundance table) the counts for each ASV
         (in the Normal output) and its reverse complement (in the Swapped output) are summed.

      The shell command to do this is:
         ../../../scripts/MixedOrientationSeqLibs/multiCombineNormalAndSwapped.sh > log.combineNormalAndSwapped.txt
         
      This will produce asvs.noChimera.combined.{RNA,DNA}.{fasta,tsv} as well as dendrograms to
      check whether each sample's Normal and Swapped compositions are similar (clustering the
      samples based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity).


Note: We rejected the idea of creating new FASTQs in which the backwards nifH were corrected by
reverse complementing. The problem with this approach is that it would move the downstream bases,
with substantially degraded quality, to the front of the corrected reads, which would impact DADA2
error models and ASVs.
