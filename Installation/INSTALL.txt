The nifH ASV workflow requires the DADA2 nifH pipeline:
  https://github.com/jdmagasin/nifH_amplicons_DADA2
as well as several external tools.  This document explains how to create a conda
environment "nifH_ASV_workflow" that includes the pipeline and all required
tools.

You should have already installed miniconda (or mamba) as well as the DADA2 nifH
pipeline following the directions in the Installation directory at the GitHub
link above.

To create the nifH_ASV_workflow environment, use conda (or mamba) as shown in
this following shell command.  (BASH shell recommended. Here the shell prompt
shows that the "base" conda environment is active.)

    (base) % conda env create --file environment_nifH_ASV_workflow.yml

Installation will take just a few minutes.  You can see the new environment
listed among your other environments with:

    (base) % conda env list


To use the workflow you must activate the nifH_ASV_workflow environment as
follows:

    (base) % conda activate nifH_ASV_workflow
    (nifH_ASV_workflow) %

The shell prompt changed to nifH_ASV_workflow.  The DADA2 nifH pipeline and
ancillary scripts, as well as all additional tools needed to run the workflow,
are now accessible.


Technical detail: The installation of the DADA2 nifH pipeline created the conda
environment DADA2_nifH. That is a completely separate environment from the
workflow conda environment you just created, nifH_ASV_workflow.  Because the
pipeline installation also changed your shell PATH to include the pipeline's
core and ancillary scripts, those scripts remain accessible to the workflow.
